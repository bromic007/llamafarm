# Git Workflow Standards

## Commit Message Format

Use Conventional Commits format:

```
type(scope): short description

Optional longer description explaining the change.
```

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci, build, style

**Scope**: The subsystem affected (cli, server, rag, runtime, designer, config)

## Claude Attribution

**NEVER add Claude as a co-author or mention Claude in commits or PRs.**

- Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar lines
- Do NOT mention "generated by Claude" or "AI-assisted" in commit messages
- Do NOT mention Claude in PR titles or descriptions
- The human user is the author of the work

## Pre-commit Hooks

**NEVER skip pre-commit hooks.**

- Do NOT use `--no-verify` flag
- If hooks fail, fix the issues and retry
- Hooks exist to maintain code quality

## Commit Best Practices

- One logical change per commit
- Write commit messages that explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names derived from the commit type:

- `feat-cli-add-project-list`
- `fix-server-memory-leak`
- `refactor-rag-embeddings`

## Force Push Policy

- NEVER force push to main/master
- Only force push to feature branches when explicitly requested
- Prefer rebase over force push when possible
