# Time-Series Forecasting Addon
#
# Provides time-series forecasting using classical methods (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing,
# Theta via Darts) and zero-shot foundation models (Amazon Chronos).
# Supports training, prediction with confidence intervals, and model persistence.

description: Forecast time-series data with Darts (ARIMA, ExpSmoothing, Theta) and Amazon Chronos
component: universal-runtime
version: "1.0.0"

packages:
  - darts>=0.29.0
  - chronos-forecasting>=1.2.0

hardware_notes:
  cuda: Chronos foundation model benefits significantly from GPU acceleration
  metal: MPS acceleration available for Chronos inference
  cpu: Classical methods (ARIMA, ExpSmoothing) run efficiently on CPU; Chronos is slower
