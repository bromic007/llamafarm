# Troubleshooting & FAQ

Common symptoms, their causes, and how to resolve them when working with LlamaFarm.

## CLI & Chat

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| `Server is degraded` banner | A dependency (Celery, rag-service, Ollama) is slow or offline. | Ensure services are running, restart `lf start`, inspect logs. |
| `No response received` | Runtime returned an empty stream (model/tool mismatch). | Use `--no-rag`, switch to an agent handler the model supports, or choose a different model. |
| `InstructorRetryException: ... does not support tools` | You selected structured output but the model lacks tool support. | Set `instructor_mode: null` and use simple chat, or choose a capable model. |
| `context deadline exceeded` during queries | Long-running HTTP request or server busy. | Increase timeout, retry after the worker finishes, or scale workers. |

## Dataset Processing

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| `Task timed out or failed: PENDING` | Celery worker still ingesting large files. | Wait, then rerun `lf datasets process`; monitor worker logs. |
| Duplicates skipped | File already processed (hash matches). | Remove the file or ingest new content; duplicates are safe to ignore. |
| Metadata mismatch warnings | Strategy name or database not defined in config. | Update `llamafarm.yaml` to include the strategy/database. |

## Configuration Errors

| Error | Fix |
| ----- | --- |
| `runtime.provider is not one of ...` | Update provider enum or choose a supported value. |
| `Missing required property runtime.base_url` | Provide `base_url` when using non-default provider endpoints (vLLM, Together). |
| `llamafarm.yaml not found` | Run `lf init` or set `--cwd` to a directory containing the config. |

## Sessions & State

- Delete `.llamafarm/projects/<namespace>/<project>/dev/context` to reset dev chat history.
- Use a new namespace (`lf init --namespace new-team`) for isolated experiments.
- Pass explicit `session_id` to API calls or set `LLAMAFARM_SESSION_ID` when testing stateless flows.

## Extensibility Pitfalls

- Forgot to regenerate types after editing `config/schema.yaml` or `rag/schema.yaml` → run `config/generate-types.sh`.
- Added a provider/store without updating docs → document how to configure it so others know it exists.
- CLI command not appearing → ensure you added it via `rootCmd.AddCommand()` and compiled with `go build`.
