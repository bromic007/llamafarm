### How It Works

1. **Document Upload** – Drop your medical PDF into the browser interface
2. **Client-Side Parsing** – PDF is parsed using PDF.js entirely in JavaScript
3. **Semantic Chunking** – Text is split into meaningful chunks with medical context
4. **Query Processing** – Your question is analyzed by a fast model to generate optimal search queries
5. **RAG Retrieval** – Relevant information is retrieved from both your documents and the medical knowledge base
6. **Response Generation** – A more capable model synthesizes the information into a comprehensive answer
7. **Stream & Display** – Response is streamed in real-time with citations and reasoning

## Use Cases

### 🩺 Understanding Test Results
Ask questions like:
- "What does my hemoglobin A1c level of 6.8% mean?"
- "Should I be concerned about elevated liver enzymes?"
- "Explain my cholesterol panel results"

### 💊 Medication Information
Get context about prescriptions:
- "What are the side effects of metformin?"
- "Why was I prescribed this medication?"
- "Are there any drug interactions I should know about?"

### 🏥 Procedure Preparation
Prepare for medical procedures:
- "What should I expect before my colonoscopy?"
- "How do I prepare for an MRI with contrast?"
- "What are the risks of this surgery?"

### 📋 Medical History Synthesis
Consolidate your records:
- "Summarize my visits from the last 6 months"
- "What were my blood pressure trends over time?"
- "List all medications I've been prescribed"

### 🔍 Second Opinion Research
Research conditions and treatments:
- "What are alternative treatments for hypertension?"
- "What does current research say about this diagnosis?"
- "Are there any clinical trials for my condition?"

## Privacy & Security

### HIPAA Compliance Considerations

While this application is designed with privacy in mind, consider these factors:

✅ **What's Private:**
- All PDF parsing happens client-side
- Documents are not stored on any server
- Queries are processed locally via LlamaFarm
- No data is sent to external APIs

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- LlamaFarm must be running locally (not exposed to internet)
- Ensure your machine is secured (encrypted disk, screensaver lock)
- Consider using this on a dedicated, air-gapped machine for maximum security
- Review your local network security if accessing from multiple devices

### Data Flow

```
Your Device Only:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Browser (PDF Parsing) ──> LlamaFarm (Local) ──> Models │
│  No Internet Required     No Server Upload    Local RAM │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Performance Tips

### Hardware Recommendations

**Minimum Configuration:**
- **CPU**: 4 cores (8 recommended)
- **RAM**: 16GB (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50GB free space for models and knowledge base
- **GPU**: Optional, but significantly speeds up inference

**Optimal Configuration:**
- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **RAM**: 32GB+
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (for faster inference)
- **Storage**: SSD recommended

### Model Selection

Choose models based on your hardware:

| Hardware | Fast Model | Capable Model |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| CPU Only | llama3.2:1b | llama3.2:3b |
| 8GB GPU | llama3.2:3b | qwen2.5:7b |
| 16GB GPU | llama3.2:3b | qwen2.5:14b |
| 24GB+ GPU | llama3.2:3b | qwen2.5:32b |

## Technical Details

### PDF Processing Pipeline

The client-side PDF processing uses PDF.js to:
1. Extract text content page by page
2. Preserve formatting and structure
3. Identify tables and lists
4. Extract metadata (dates, patient info)

### RAG Strategy

The multi-hop agentic RAG approach:
1. **Query Analysis** – Fast model analyzes the user's question
2. **Query Generation** – Generate multiple search queries to capture different aspects
3. **Retrieval** – Semantic search across knowledge base + user documents
4. **Re-ranking** – Score and filter results by relevance
5. **Synthesis** – Capable model generates comprehensive response with citations

### Streaming Implementation

Responses stream using Server-Sent Events (SSE):
```javascript
// Client-side streaming handler
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/chat');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const chunk = JSON.parse(event.data);
  appendToChat(chunk.content);
};
```

## Limitations

### What This Tool Is NOT

❌ **Not a replacement for medical professionals** – Always consult qualified healthcare providers
❌ **Not for emergencies** – Call 911 or go to the ER for urgent medical issues
❌ **Not diagnostic** – Cannot diagnose conditions or prescribe treatments
❌ **Not medical advice** – For informational and educational purposes only

### Known Limitations

- **Language support** – Currently optimized for English medical documents
- **Handwritten notes** – Cannot process handwritten records (OCR not included)
- **Image analysis** – Cannot interpret medical images (X-rays, CT scans, etc.)
- **Complex tables** – May have difficulty with intricate tabular data
- **Real-time data** – Cannot access current labs or vitals from healthcare systems

## Troubleshooting

### PDFs Not Parsing

**Problem:** Uploaded PDF shows no content
**Solutions:**
- Check if PDF is encrypted (password-protected)
- Ensure PDF contains text (not scanned images without OCR)
- Try a different PDF viewer to verify file integrity
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Slow Response Times

**Problem:** AI responses take too long
**Solutions:**
- Switch to smaller/faster models
- Reduce RAG top-k setting (retrieve fewer chunks)
- Increase score threshold (more selective retrieval)
- Check system resources (CPU/RAM usage)
- Consider GPU acceleration

### Poor Answer Quality

**Problem:** Responses are vague or incorrect
**Solutions:**
- Use a more capable model for response generation
- Increase top-k to retrieve more context
- Ensure medical knowledge base is properly processed
- Refine your questions to be more specific
- Check that relevant documents are uploaded

### LlamaFarm Connection Issues

**Problem:** Cannot connect to LlamaFarm API
**Solutions:**
- Verify LlamaFarm is running: `lf start`
- Check API endpoint in `.env.local`
- Ensure correct port (default: 14345)
- Check firewall settings
- Review LlamaFarm logs for errors
