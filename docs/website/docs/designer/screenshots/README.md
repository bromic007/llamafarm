## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Resolution**: At least 1200px wide for clarity
- **Browser**: Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar, etc.)
- **Theme**: Either light or dark mode is fine, but be consistent
- **Content**: Use example/demo projects to avoid exposing private information
- **Cropping**: Include enough context to understand the UI, but remove unnecessary browser chrome

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Start the Designer: `lf start`
2. Open http://localhost:7724 in your browser
3. Navigate to each section
4. Take screenshots using your OS screenshot tool
5. Name them according to the list above
6. Place them in this directory
7. The documentation will automatically reference them

## Optional: Annotating Screenshots

If you want to highlight specific features, consider:
- Adding arrows or callouts using an image editor
- Circling important UI elements
- Adding brief text labels

Keep annotations minimal and professional.
