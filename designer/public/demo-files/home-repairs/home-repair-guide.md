# Plumbing Repairs

## When to DIY vs. Call a Plumber

### Safe for DIY
- Unclogging drains
- Replacing faucet aerators and showerheads
- Fixing running toilets
- Replacing toilet flappers and fill valves
- Tightening loose connections
- Replacing sink P-traps
- Installing new faucets (if supply lines exist)
- Replacing garbage disposal

### Call a Professional
- Anything involving the main water line
- Water heater repairs (gas especially)
- Sewer line issues
- Frozen pipes (risk of bursting)
- No hot water (could be gas/electrical issue)
- Low water pressure throughout house
- Permit-required work
- Anything you're not confident about

## Clogged Drains

### Bathroom Sink (Usually Hair + Soap Buildup)

**Step 1: Remove visible debris**
- Unscrew or pop out the drain stopper
- Pull out hair and gunk with needle-nose pliers or a drain snake
- This alone often fixes slow drains

**Step 2: Boiling water**
- Pour a kettle of boiling water directly down drain
- Wait 5 minutes, repeat
- Works for soap/grease buildup

**Step 3: Baking soda + vinegar**
- Pour 1/2 cup baking soda down drain
- Follow with 1/2 cup white vinegar
- Cover drain, wait 30 minutes
- Flush with boiling water
- Safe for pipes, good for maintenance

**Step 4: Plunger**
- Use a cup plunger (not a flange plunger)
- Block overflow hole with wet rag
- Fill sink with 2-3 inches of water
- Plunge vigorously 15-20 times

**Step 5: P-trap removal**
- Place bucket under P-trap (curved pipe under sink)
- Unscrew slip nuts by hand or with pliers
- Remove trap, clean out debris
- Reassemble (hand-tight, then 1/4 turn with pliers)

### Kitchen Sink

**Garbage disposal clogged:**
- Turn OFF disposal and never put hand inside
- Press reset button on bottom of unit
- Use Allen wrench in bottom hole to manually rotate
- If still stuck, see Garbage Disposal section below

**Grease clogs:**
- Never use boiling water on grease (can melt and re-solidify deeper)
- Use dish soap + hot (not boiling) water
- Better: enzymatic drain cleaner (Bio-Clean, etc.)
- Prevention: Never pour grease down drain

### Toilet Clogs

**Standard clog:**
- Use a flange plunger (has extended rubber flap)
- Ensure plunger is submerged in water
- Push down slowly, pull up sharply
- Repeat 15-20 times
- Flush to test

**Stubborn clog:**
- Toilet auger (closet auger) - feeds cable into toilet
- Insert, crank handle to extend and break up clog
- Never use a regular drain snake (scratches porcelain)

**Warning signs of bigger problems:**
- Multiple fixtures backing up = main line issue
- Gurgling sounds from other drains
- Water backing up in tub when toilet flushes

## Running Toilet

A running toilet wastes 200+ gallons per day. Usually an easy fix.

### Diagnose the Problem

**Test 1: Flapper test**
- Remove tank lid
- Push down on flapper with stick
- If running stops, flapper needs replacement

**Test 2: Float test**
- Lift the float arm/cup
- If running stops, adjust float level or replace fill valve

**Test 3: Overflow test**
- Water level should be 1" below overflow tube
- If water is flowing into overflow, float is set too high

### Replacing the Flapper ($5-10, 10 minutes)

Most common fix for running toilets.

1. Turn off water supply (valve behind toilet)
2. Flush to empty tank
3. Unhook old flapper from overflow tube
4. Disconnect chain from flush handle
5. Take old flapper to store to match size/type
6. Install new flapper, connect chain
7. Turn water on, test flush
8. Adjust chain length (1/2" slack when closed)

### Adjusting or Replacing Fill Valve

**To adjust float level:**
- Ball float: Bend rod down slightly, or turn adjustment screw
- Cup float: Pinch clip on rod and slide float down

**To replace fill valve ($15-25, 30 minutes):**
1. Turn off water, flush, sponge out remaining water
2. Disconnect supply line from bottom of tank
3. Unscrew locknut under tank
4. Remove old valve
5. Adjust new valve height (top should be 1" above overflow)
6. Install new valve, hand-tighten locknut
7. Connect supply line
8. Turn on water, adjust float to proper level

## Leaky Faucets

### Dripping from Spout

**Compression faucet (two handles, older style):**
- Usually worn washers or O-rings
- Turn off water under sink
- Remove handle (screw under cap or set screw)
- Unscrew packing nut, pull out stem
- Replace rubber washer at bottom (take to store to match)
- Reassemble, turn water on

**Cartridge faucet (single handle, most common modern):**
- Turn off water
- Remove handle (set screw usually under cap)
- Pull out retaining clip
- Pull out cartridge (may need cartridge puller tool)
- Take cartridge to store, buy exact replacement
- Install new cartridge (note orientation)
- Reassemble

**Ball faucet (single handle, ball mechanism):**
- Usually needs a repair kit specific to brand
- Kit includes springs, seats, O-rings, ball
- Follow kit instructions

### Leaking from Base

Usually worn O-rings on the faucet body.

1. Turn off water
2. Remove handle and spout
3. Replace O-rings (take old ones to store to match size)
4. Apply plumber's grease to new O-rings
5. Reassemble

### Leaking Under Sink

- Check supply line connections (hand-tighten)
- Check P-trap connections
- Check sprayer hose connections
- Look for cracked supply lines (replace if older braided lines)

## Garbage Disposal Issues

### Disposal Won't Turn On

**Check 1: Reset button**
- Located on bottom of unit
- Press firmly
- Wait a minute, try again

**Check 2: Electrical**
- Check if outlet works (plug in something else)
- Check circuit breaker
- If hardwired, check the switch

**Check 3: Overheated**
- If it was running and stopped, may be overheated
- Wait 15 minutes, press reset, try again

### Disposal Hums But Won't Spin

Motor works but blades are stuck.

1. Turn OFF disposal (important!)
2. Never put hand inside
3. Insert Allen wrench in hole at bottom center
4. Turn back and forth to free blades
5. Remove debris with tongs (never hands)
6. Press reset, turn on with water running

### Disposal Drains Slowly

- Usually food buildup in drain pipe
- Run cold water for 30 seconds while running disposal
- Grind ice cubes to clean blades
- Never use chemical drain cleaners (damages seals)
- May need to clean P-trap

### Things to Never Put in Disposal

- Grease or oil
- Fibrous foods (celery, corn husks, artichokes)
- Pasta or rice (expands)
- Bones (small chicken bones are okay)
- Coffee grounds (accumulate in pipes)
- Potato peels (starchy paste)
- Egg shells (membrane causes issues)

## Water Heater Basics

### Signs You Need Service

- No hot water
- Water not hot enough
- Strange noises (popping, rumbling)
- Rusty water
- Water pooling around base
- Rotten egg smell (anode rod failing)

### Maintenance You Can Do

**Annual drain (removes sediment):**
1. Turn off power (breaker for electric, gas valve to pilot for gas)
2. Turn off cold water supply
3. Connect hose to drain valve at bottom
4. Open drain valve, let water flow until clear
5. Close drain, refill tank, restore power

**Check T&P valve annually:**
- Temperature and Pressure relief valve
- Lift lever briefly - water should flow
- If not, valve needs replacement (call pro for this)

### When to Replace

- Tank over 10-12 years old
- Rusty water from hot tap only
- Rumbling/popping that doesn't stop after draining
- Visible rust or leaks on tank
- Repeated repairs needed

## Shutoff Valves - Know Before Emergency

### Main Water Shutoff

**Locate it NOW, before you need it:**
- Usually near water meter
- Could be in basement, crawl space, utility closet
- Outdoor valve near street (curb stop) as backup
- Test it annually - old valves can seize

### Fixture Shutoffs

- **Under sinks**: Oval handles on supply lines
- **Behind toilets**: Oval handle on wall or floor
- **Behind washing machine**: Two valves (hot and cold)
- **Water heater**: Cold water inlet valve on top

If fixture shutoff doesn't work or leaks when turned, use main shutoff and replace valve.

### In an Emergency

1. Turn off main water supply
2. Open lowest faucet in house to drain pipes
3. Call plumber
4. If leak is severe and you can't find shutoff, call water company

## Common Plumbing Sounds

### Water Hammer (Loud Bang When Faucet Closes)

- Caused by sudden stop of water flow
- Install water hammer arrestors near problem fixtures
- Or: turn off main, open all faucets to drain, close faucets, turn main back on (recharges air chambers)

### Gurgling Drains

- Usually a venting issue
- P-trap may be dry (run water)
- Could indicate partial main line clog
- If multiple fixtures gurgle, call plumber

### Whistling Pipes

- Usually a worn washer or valve
- Check toilet fill valve
- Check any valve that was recently used
- May need pressure reducing valve if pressure too high

### Rattling Pipes

- Pipes not properly secured
- Add pipe straps or cushioning where pipes contact framing
- Especially common in older homes

# Electrical Basics and Safety

## Critical Safety Rules

### Before Any Electrical Work

1. **Turn off power at the breaker** - Never trust a switch alone
2. **Test with a voltage tester** - Confirm power is off before touching wires
3. **Use insulated tools** - Rubber or plastic handles only
4. **Never work in wet conditions** - Water conducts electricity
5. **When in doubt, call an electrician** - Electrical mistakes can kill

### Warning Signs That Require an Electrician

Call a professional immediately if you notice:
- Burning smell from outlets or switches
- Sparks from outlets
- Frequent circuit breaker trips
- Flickering lights throughout house
- Buzzing or crackling sounds from outlets
- Outlets or switches warm to touch
- Two-prong outlets (ungrounded) you want to upgrade
- Aluminum wiring (pre-1972 homes)
- Any work requiring a permit

### Know Your Limits

**Safe for most DIYers:**
- Replacing light switches (same type)
- Replacing outlets (same type)
- Installing light fixtures (existing box and wiring)
- Replacing ceiling fan (existing support and wiring)
- Resetting breakers

**Requires electrician:**
- Adding new circuits
- Upgrading electrical panel
- Any work in the panel box
- Adding outlets or switches
- Outdoor wiring
- Anything involving permits
- Knob-and-tube or aluminum wiring

## Understanding Your Electrical Panel

### Circuit Breakers

**What they do:**
- Protect wiring from overheating
- Trip (shut off) when circuit is overloaded
- Each breaker controls one circuit

**Breaker sizes:**
- 15 amp: General lighting and outlets
- 20 amp: Kitchen, bathroom, garage outlets
- 30 amp: Dryers, some AC units
- 40-50 amp: Ranges, large AC units
- 100-200 amp: Main breaker (whole house)

### Resetting a Tripped Breaker

1. Identify the tripped breaker (usually in middle position, not fully off)
2. Unplug devices on that circuit
3. **Safety:** Stand to the side of the panel (not directly in front) and look away when flipping breakers
4. Push breaker firmly to OFF position
5. Then push to ON position
6. If it trips again immediately, you have a short - do not reset again, call electrician

### When Breakers Trip Frequently

**Same breaker trips repeatedly:**
- Circuit overloaded (too many devices)
- Move some devices to different circuits
- Faulty appliance (unplug, see if problem stops)
- Possible short in wiring (call electrician)

**Multiple breakers trip:**
- Possible main panel issue
- Could indicate serious problem
- Call electrician

## Replacing an Outlet

### Tools Needed
- Flathead and Phillips screwdrivers
- Voltage tester (non-contact type is easiest)
- Needle-nose pliers
- New outlet (match amp rating to existing)

### Standard Outlet Replacement

**Step 1: Turn off power**
- Find correct breaker and turn off
- Test outlet with voltage tester to confirm power is off

**Step 2: Remove old outlet**
- Remove cover plate
- Unscrew outlet from box
- Pull outlet out carefully
- Note wire positions before disconnecting:
  - Black (hot) wire → brass screw
  - White (neutral) wire → silver screw
  - Green or bare (ground) wire → green screw

**Step 3: Install new outlet**
- Connect ground wire first (green screw)
- Connect white wire to silver screw
- Connect black wire to brass screw
- Wrap wires clockwise around screws
- Tighten screws firmly
- Push outlet back into box
- Screw outlet to box (don't overtighten)
- Install cover plate

**Step 4: Restore power and test**
- Turn breaker back on
- Test with outlet tester or plug in lamp

### GFCI Outlets

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter outlets are required in:
- Bathrooms
- Kitchens (within 6 feet of sink)
- Garages
- Outdoors
- Near pools/hot tubs
- Laundry areas
- Basements

**GFCI Installation:**
- Has LINE terminals (incoming power) and LOAD terminals (downstream outlets)
- Incoming wires connect to LINE only if just protecting one outlet
- Downstream wires connect to LOAD to protect multiple outlets
- Follow instructions carefully - LINE and LOAD matter

**Testing GFCI:**
- Press TEST button - should click and cut power
- Press RESET to restore power
- Test monthly
- Replace if TEST button doesn't trip outlet

## Replacing a Light Switch

### Single-Pole Switch (Most Common)

Controls light from one location.

**Step 1: Turn off power and verify**
- Flip breaker, test with voltage tester

**Step 2: Remove old switch**
- Remove cover plate
- Unscrew switch from box
- Note wire connections (take photo if helpful)
- Usually two black wires and one ground
- **Note:** In older homes, a white wire may be used as hot (called a "switch loop") - it should be marked with black tape. If you see this, connect it like a black wire.
- Disconnect wires

**Step 3: Connect new switch**
- Connect ground wire to green screw
- Connect black wires to brass screws (doesn't matter which)
- Push switch into box, screw in place
- Install cover plate

### Three-Way Switch

Controls light from two locations (like top and bottom of stairs).

**Identifying three-way:**
- Has three screws (plus ground)
- One screw is different color (common terminal)

**Replacing:**
- Mark or note which wire is on common (different colored) screw
- Usually the common wire is black or marked
- Connect common wire to common terminal on new switch
- Other two wires (travelers) go to remaining screws
- Order of travelers doesn't matter

### Dimmer Switches

**Compatibility:**
- Check bulb compatibility (LED dimmers for LED bulbs)
- Check wattage rating (must exceed total bulb wattage)
- Single-pole or three-way (must match)

**Installation:**
- Usually connects with wire nuts instead of screws
- Match wire colors: black to black, white to white, ground to ground
- Follow included instructions for specific model

## Light Fixture Replacement

### Before You Start

- Turn off power at breaker
- Verify power is off with voltage tester
- Ensure electrical box can support fixture weight
  - Standard boxes: up to 50 lbs
  - Fan-rated boxes: required for ceiling fans
- Have a helper for heavy fixtures

### Standard Fixture Replacement

**Step 1: Remove old fixture**
- Remove bulbs, globes, any removable parts
- Unscrew mounting screws or nuts
- Lower fixture carefully (don't let it hang by wires)
- Disconnect wires (usually wire nuts)
- Remove mounting bracket if necessary

**Step 2: Install new mounting bracket**
- Attach new bracket (if different from old)
- Thread wires through bracket

**Step 3: Connect wires**
- Ground wire (green or bare) connects first
- White to white (neutral)
- Black to black (hot)
- Use wire nuts, twist clockwise until tight
- Tug each wire to verify secure connection

**Step 4: Mount fixture**
- Follow specific fixture instructions
- Don't overtighten screws (can crack fixture)
- Install bulbs and globes

### Ceiling Fan Installation

**Critical requirements:**
- Must have fan-rated electrical box (supports weight and vibration)
- If not, install fan-rated box before proceeding
- This may require attic access or professional help

**Basic process:**
- Similar to light fixture
- Usually has mounting bracket that attaches to box
- Fan hangs from bracket during wiring
- Connect wires per instructions
- Attach blades and light kit

## Common Electrical Problems

### Outlet Doesn't Work

**Check 1: GFCI tripped**
- Find GFCI outlet in room (or bathroom/kitchen)
- Press RESET button
- One GFCI may control multiple outlets

**Check 2: Breaker tripped**
- Check electrical panel
- Reset breaker (off then on)

**Check 3: Loose connection**
- Turn off power, remove outlet, check wire connections
- Loose wires are a fire hazard - secure properly

### Light Flickers

**Just one fixture:**
- Try tightening bulb
- Replace bulb
- Check wire connections at fixture
- Check switch connections

**Multiple fixtures or whole house:**
- Could be utility issue (check with neighbors)
- Loose connection at panel or meter (call electrician)
- Failing main breaker (call electrician)

### Outlet Sparks When Plugging In

**Occasional small spark:**
- Normal when plugging into live outlet
- Electricity arcing to plug prongs

**Frequent, large, or colored sparks:**
- Sign of loose connection or worn outlet
- Turn off power, inspect outlet
- Replace if damaged
- If problem persists, call electrician

### Warm Outlets or Switches

**Slightly warm dimmer switch:**
- Normal for dimmers

**Warm standard switch or outlet:**
- Turn off power immediately
- Check wire connections
- May have loose connection (fire hazard)
- Call electrician if unsure

### Burning Smell

- Turn off breaker immediately
- Do not use circuit until inspected
- Call electrician same day
- Could indicate overheating wire (fire hazard)

## Extension Cord and Power Strip Safety

### Extension Cord Rules

- Use only temporarily
- Never run under rugs or through walls
- Match cord rating to device needs:
  - 16 gauge: Light duty (lamps, small electronics)
  - 14 gauge: Medium duty (power tools)
  - 12 gauge: Heavy duty (large tools, heaters)
- Use outdoor-rated cords outside
- Never daisy-chain extension cords

### Power Strip vs. Surge Protector

**Power strips:** Just provide more outlets - no protection

**Surge protectors:** Protect electronics from voltage spikes
- Look for UL listing
- Check joule rating (higher = more protection)
- Replace after major surge (even if working)
- Have indicator light showing protection status

### What Not to Plug Into Power Strips

Never plug these into power strips or extension cords:
- Space heaters
- Air conditioners
- Refrigerators
- Microwaves
- Other high-draw appliances

These should plug directly into wall outlets.

# Drywall Repair

## Types of Drywall Damage

### Small Holes (Nail holes, small dents)
- Under 1/2 inch
- Easiest repair
- Just needs spackle

### Medium Holes (Doorknob holes, anchor holes)
- 1/2 inch to 4 inches
- Needs patch or mesh tape
- Moderate skill level

### Large Holes (Fist-sized and up)
- Over 4 inches
- Needs drywall patch piece
- More involved repair

### Cracks
- Hairline cracks
- Larger cracks
- Corner cracks (often structural movement)

### Water Damage
- Staining
- Bubbling
- Sagging or soft drywall
- Must fix water source first

## Small Hole Repair (Under 1/2 Inch)

### Materials Needed
- Lightweight spackle (DAP, Drydex, etc.)
- Putty knife (2-3 inch)
- Fine sandpaper (120-150 grit)
- Primer (if painting)

### Steps

**1. Prepare the hole**
- Clean any loose debris
- If nail is still in, remove it
- For popped nails: drive drywall screw 1 inch above or below, then remove nail

**2. Apply spackle**
- Load putty knife with spackle
- Press into hole at angle
- Smooth flat, feathering edges
- Slightly overfill (spackle shrinks when drying)

**3. Let dry**
- Lightweight spackle: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- Check that color changes (most go from pink/blue to white when dry)

**4. Sand smooth**
- Use fine sandpaper
- Sand in circular motion
- Feather edges to blend with wall
- Wipe dust with damp cloth

**5. Prime and paint**
- Spot-prime repaired area
- Paint entire wall for best match

## Medium Hole Repair (1/2 to 4 Inches)

### Option 1: Self-Adhesive Mesh Patch

Best for holes 1-3 inches.

**Materials:**
- Self-adhesive mesh patch (sized to cover hole)
- Joint compound (not spackle - need more body)
- 6-inch putty knife
- Sandpaper

**Steps:**

1. Clean hole edges, remove loose paper or debris
2. Center mesh patch over hole, press firmly
3. Apply thin coat of joint compound over patch
4. Spread beyond patch edges by 2 inches
5. Let dry completely (follow product directions)
6. Apply second coat, feathering edges further out
7. Let dry
8. Sand smooth
9. Apply third coat if needed
10. Final sand, prime, and paint

### Option 2: California Patch (No Backing Needed)

Good for 2-4 inch holes. Creates its own backing.

**Materials:**
- Drywall piece (cut 2 inches larger than hole each direction)
- Joint compound
- Utility knife
- 6-inch putty knife

**Steps:**

1. Cut drywall patch 2 inches larger than hole in both dimensions
2. Flip patch over (back side up)
3. Score the back paper 1 inch from each edge
4. Snap and peel off the outer edges of drywall, leaving back paper intact
5. You now have center piece with paper "wings"
6. Apply joint compound around hole edges
7. Press patch into hole - paper wings stick to wall
8. Apply joint compound over entire patch
9. Feather edges, let dry
10. Repeat 2-3 coats, sanding between
11. Prime and paint

## Large Hole Repair (Over 4 Inches)

### Materials Needed
- Drywall piece (same thickness as existing - usually 1/2")
- Furring strips or drywall repair clips
- Drywall screws
- Joint compound
- Mesh tape or paper tape
- 6-inch and 10-inch putty knives
- Drill
- Drywall saw
- Sandpaper

### Steps

**1. Square up the hole**
- Draw rectangle around damaged area
- Use level to draw straight lines
- Cut along lines with drywall saw
- Remove damaged section

**2. Install backing**

*Option A: Furring strips*
- Cut 1x3 or 1x4 boards a few inches longer than hole
- Insert behind hole, hold against back of drywall
- Screw through front of existing drywall into board
- Two boards (top and bottom) for support

*Option B: Repair clips (easier)*
- Clip onto edge of existing drywall
- Provides screwing surface for patch

**3. Cut patch**
- Measure hole exactly
- Cut drywall to fit
- Test fit - should be snug but not forced

**4. Install patch**
- Screw patch to backing (furring strips or clips)
- Screws slightly below surface
- If using clips, snap off tabs after screwing

**5. Tape seams**
- Apply thin layer of joint compound over seams
- Press mesh tape or paper tape into compound
- Apply more compound over tape
- Feather edges

**6. Multiple coats**
- Let first coat dry completely
- Apply second coat, spreading wider
- Let dry, sand lightly
- Apply third coat, feathering edges 8-12 inches
- Final sand when dry

**7. Prime and paint**
- Prime entire patched area
- Paint (full wall for best match)

## Crack Repair

### Hairline Cracks

Usually from settling or seasonal movement.

1. Widen crack slightly with utility knife (V-shape)
2. Apply joint compound, pressing into crack
3. Let dry, sand, apply second coat
4. Sand smooth, prime, paint

### Recurring Cracks

Cracks that keep coming back need flexible repair.

1. Widen crack slightly
2. Apply joint compound
3. Embed paper tape or mesh tape
4. Apply two more coats
5. Consider flexible caulk for corners

### Corner Cracks

Often occur where walls meet ceiling.

1. Cut out any loose tape or compound
2. Apply fresh compound
3. Embed new tape (paper or mesh)
4. Finish with 2-3 coats
5. For recurring problems: use paintable caulk instead

### When Cracks Indicate Problems

Call a professional if you see:
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- Stair-step cracks in brick
- Cracks with displacement (one side higher)
- Cracks that grow quickly
- Cracks accompanied by sticking doors/windows
- Cracks around windows/doors at 45-degree angles

## Water Damage Repair

### Important First Steps

1. **Find and fix the water source first**
2. Let area dry completely (may take days)
3. Check for mold (call professional if significant mold present)

### Repairing Water-Stained Drywall

If drywall is solid (not soft or crumbling):

1. Let dry completely
2. Apply stain-blocking primer (Kilz, BIN, etc.)
   - Water stains bleed through regular paint
3. Paint over primer

### Repairing Soft or Damaged Drywall

If drywall is soft, bubbled, or crumbling:

1. Cut out all damaged drywall
2. Extend cut to solid drywall
3. Check for mold on studs (treat or call professional)
4. Let framing dry completely
5. Install new drywall (see large hole repair)
6. Prime and paint

### Signs of Hidden Water Damage

- Bubbling or peeling paint
- Soft spots when pressed
- Musty smell
- Visible staining
- Sagging ceiling

## Tips for Invisible Repairs

### Feathering
- Each coat should extend 2-3 inches beyond previous
- Final coat may be 10-12 inches wide
- Gradual feathering makes repair invisible

### Sanding
- Don't sand to bare paper (creates visible spot)
- Use fine grit (150+)
- Wipe with damp cloth, not dry (dry creates dust that shows)

### Priming
- Always prime repairs before painting
- Repaired areas absorb paint differently
- Unprimed repairs show as dull spots

### Texture Matching
- Smooth walls: Easier - just sand smooth
- Orange peel: Use spray can texture, practice first
- Knockdown: Apply texture, let set briefly, knock down with knife
- Heavy texture: May need to texture larger area to blend

### Paint Matching
- Best results: Paint entire wall, corner to corner
- Touching up: Use original paint, feather edges
- If no original paint: Get color matched, paint full wall

# Interior Painting

## Preparation (80% of a Good Paint Job)

### Room Preparation

**Move and cover:**
- Remove all furniture possible
- Move remaining furniture to center, cover with drop cloths
- Remove switch plates, outlet covers, light fixtures
- Remove door hardware or tape over
- Cover floors with canvas drop cloths (plastic is slippery)

**Clean surfaces:**
- Dust walls and ceilings
- Wash kitchen/bathroom walls (grease and moisture residue)
- TSP substitute or degreaser for heavy cleaning
- Let dry completely before painting

### Surface Preparation

**Fill holes and cracks:**
- Nail holes: Lightweight spackle
- Larger holes: Joint compound (see drywall guide)
- Cracks: Joint compound with mesh tape for recurring cracks

**Sand surfaces:**
- Glossy surfaces must be sanded for paint adhesion
- Scuff sand with 150 grit
- Sand any repairs smooth
- Wipe dust with tack cloth or damp rag

**Repair problem areas:**
- Peeling paint: Scrape loose paint, feather edges, prime bare spots
- Water stains: Stain-blocking primer required
- Mold/mildew: Kill with bleach solution, prime with mold-resistant primer

### Priming

**When primer is required:**
- Bare drywall or wood
- Drywall repairs
- Over stains (water, smoke, marker)
- Drastic color changes (especially dark to light)
- Glossy surfaces
- Previously unpainted surfaces

**When primer is optional:**
- Painting same or similar color
- Factory-primed surfaces
- Using paint-and-primer-in-one (works for light changes)

**Primer types:**
- PVA primer: New drywall
- Stain-blocking: Water stains, smoke, markers (Kilz, BIN)
- Bonding primer: Glossy surfaces, cabinets
- Shellac-based: Worst stains, odor blocking

## Choosing Paint

### Finish/Sheen Options

**Flat/Matte:**
- No shine
- Hides imperfections best
- Hard to clean
- Best for: Ceilings, low-traffic rooms, walls with imperfections

**Eggshell:**
- Slight sheen
- Easier to clean than flat
- Still hides imperfections fairly well
- Best for: Living rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms

**Satin:**
- Medium sheen
- Cleanable, somewhat durable
- Shows more imperfections
- Best for: Kitchens, bathrooms, hallways, kids' rooms

**Semi-gloss:**
- Noticeable shine
- Very cleanable and durable
- Shows all imperfections
- Best for: Trim, doors, cabinets, high-moisture areas

**High-gloss:**
- Maximum shine
- Most durable, most cleanable
- Shows every flaw
- Best for: Trim, accent areas (rarely used on walls)

### How Much Paint?

**Coverage per gallon:**
- Average: 350-400 square feet
- Rough/textured surfaces: 300 square feet
- Most rooms need 2 coats

**Calculate needs:**
- Measure wall height × width for each wall
- Subtract windows and doors
- Divide by 350 for gallons needed per coat
- Multiply by 2 for two coats
- Round up

## Cutting In (Edges and Corners)

### Technique

**Load the brush:**
- Dip brush 1/3 of bristle length into paint
- Tap against inside of can (don't scrape)

**Cut a line:**
- Start slightly away from edge
- Push brush toward edge as you draw a line
- Use the brush tip, not the flat side
- Maintain steady pressure and speed
- Work in 18-24 inch sections

**Feather the edge:**
- Before paint dries, feather the inside edge
- This helps roller blend seamlessly

### Where to Cut In

- Ceiling line (where wall meets ceiling)
- Corner lines (where walls meet)
- Around trim, windows, doors
- Around outlets and switches
- Around fixtures

### Tips for Clean Lines

**Using tape:**
- Use quality painter's tape (blue or green)
- Press edges firmly with putty knife
- Remove tape while paint is still slightly tacky
- Pull at 45-degree angle away from fresh paint

**Without tape (steady hand):**
- Use angled brush (2.5" is most versatile)
- Go slowly
- Keep brush properly loaded (not too much, not too little)
- Clean up mistakes immediately with damp cloth

## Rolling Walls

### Roller Selection

**Nap length:**
- 3/8" nap: Smooth surfaces
- 1/2" nap: Most common, slightly textured walls
- 3/4" nap: Textured surfaces, stucco

**Quality matters:**
- Cheap rollers shed fibers into paint
- Good rollers hold more paint, release more evenly

### Rolling Technique

**Load the roller:**
- Pour paint into roller tray
- Roll in tray to load
- Roll on tray ramp to distribute evenly
- Roller should be full but not dripping

**Apply paint:**
- Start with "W" or "M" pattern
- Fill in the area with parallel strokes
- Work in 3-4 foot square sections
- Maintain wet edge (overlap previous section before it dries)

**Finish strokes:**
- Final strokes should be vertical (floor to ceiling)
- Light pressure, lift roller gradually at end
- This leaves consistent texture

### Avoiding Common Problems

**Roller marks/lines:**
- Don't press too hard
- Don't let edges dry before blending
- Maintain consistent pressure
- Use quality roller

**Uneven coverage:**
- Apply two coats always
- Don't stretch paint too thin
- Reload roller frequently

**Drips:**
- Roller overloaded
- Roll out excess in tray
- Watch for drips and back-roll to smooth

## Painting Trim

### Preparation
- Sand glossy surfaces
- Fill nail holes
- Clean thoroughly
- Tape off walls or cut in carefully

### Brush Selection
- Angled sash brush: Best for most trim
- 2" or 2.5" width most versatile
- Quality brush with fine bristles

### Technique

**Doors:**
- Remove or tape hardware
- Paint panels first (if paneled door)
- Then paint horizontal rails
- Then vertical stiles
- Finally paint edges

**Windows:**
- Paint sash (moving parts) first
- Then frame
- Leave slight overlap onto glass (creates seal)
- Or tape glass edges
- Scrape excess from glass after drying

**Baseboards:**
- Cut in along floor and wall edges
- Fill in middle
- Work in 2-3 foot sections
- Feather into next section

### Sheen for Trim
- Semi-gloss: Most common, durable, cleanable
- Satin: Less shiny, still fairly durable
- High-gloss: Very durable, shows every imperfection

## Clean Up

### During Project
- Wrap brushes and rollers in plastic between coats
- Can refrigerate overnight for next-day use
- Don't let paint dry on brush

### After Project

**Latex paint:**
- Wash brushes and rollers with water
- Soap helps remove paint
- Spin rollers dry
- Store brushes in keeper or wrap bristles

**Oil-based paint:**
- Clean with mineral spirits
- Follow up with soap and water
- Proper disposal of solvents required

### Paint Storage
- Hammer lid on securely
- Store upside down (creates seal)
- Label with room name and date
- Store in climate-controlled space (not freezing)
- Most latex paint lasts 2-10 years if properly stored

# Doors and Windows

## Sticking Doors

### Diagnosing the Problem

**Where does it stick?**
- Top: Sagging door or loose top hinge
- Bottom: Swollen door or raised flooring
- Latch side: Shifted strike plate or swollen door
- Hinge side: Hinge problems

**Seasonal vs. permanent:**
- Swells in humid weather = seasonal (may not need fix)
- Sticks year-round = permanent problem

### Fixing a Sagging Door

Usually caused by loose hinge screws.

**Step 1: Tighten hinge screws**
- Open door, support bottom with wedge or book
- Tighten all hinge screws
- If screws spin freely, holes are stripped

**Step 2: Fix stripped screw holes**
- Remove hinge
- Fill holes with wood toothpicks and wood glue
- Let dry, cut flush
- Drill pilot holes
- Reattach hinge

**Step 3: Use longer screws**
- Replace one short screw in each hinge with 3" screw
- This reaches into wall stud (2x4 behind frame)
- Very effective for sagging doors

### Planing a Swollen Door

If door still sticks after hinge repair:

**Minor sticking:**
- Rub candle wax, soap, or paraffin on sticking area
- Often enough for seasonal swelling

**Needs material removed:**
- Mark sticking area with pencil
- Sand with coarse sandpaper (80 grit) or use hand plane
- Remove small amounts, test frequently
- Paint or seal bare wood to prevent future swelling

### Adjusting Strike Plate

If door doesn't latch properly:

**Latch doesn't reach strike plate:**
- Tighten hinges
- Check if strike plate can be moved

**Latch hits strike plate but doesn't enter:**
- File strike plate opening larger
- Or move strike plate (fill old holes, drill new)

## Door Won't Latch

### Problem: Latch Doesn't Align with Strike Plate

**Minor misalignment (1/8" or less):**
- File strike plate opening in direction needed

**Major misalignment:**
- Reposition strike plate
- Fill old screw holes with toothpicks/glue
- Drill new holes
- Chisel new mortise if needed

### Problem: Latch Doesn't Extend

**Check the latch mechanism:**
- Remove handle/knob
- Test latch mechanism manually
- Clean and lubricate with graphite or WD-40
- Replace latch mechanism if broken

### Problem: Door Warped

- Look down edge of door - is it straight?
- Minor warp: Weight door overnight with weights
- Major warp: May need to replace door
- Wood doors warp more than solid core or fiberglass

## Squeaky Doors

### Lubricating Hinges

**Quick fix:**
- Spray WD-40 or silicone lubricant on hinge pins
- Work door back and forth
- Wipe excess

**Better fix:**
- Remove hinge pin (tap from bottom with nail set)
- Clean pin and barrel with steel wool
- Apply petroleum jelly or white lithium grease
- Reinsert pin

### Squeaky Floor at Door

- Often the threshold, not the door
- Sprinkle baby powder or talcum in crack
- Work back and forth to get into gaps

## Windows That Won't Open

### Double-Hung Windows

**Painted shut:**
- Score paint line with utility knife
- Use putty knife between sash and frame
- Work around entire perimeter
- Tap frame gently with rubber mallet

**Stuck from humidity:**
- Same approach as painted shut
- Apply silicone spray to channels
- Sand channel if needed

**Broken sash cord/spring:**
- Older windows use counterweight system
- Modern windows use spring balances
- Both can be replaced with some effort
- Consider calling professional

### Sliding Windows

**Dirty track:**
- Vacuum debris from track
- Clean with all-purpose cleaner
- Lubricate with silicone spray

**Bent track:**
- Straighten with pliers
- Use piece of wood behind track for support

**Rollers worn:**
- Access rollers by lifting sash out
- Replace rollers (usually held by screws)

### Casement Windows (Crank-Out)

**Won't crank:**
- Clean track and hinges
- Lubricate with silicone
- Check for debris blocking track

**Crank mechanism broken:**
- Replace crank arm or operator
- Match old mechanism to new
- Usually held by screws

## Drafty Windows

### Quick Fixes

**Weather stripping:**
- Foam tape: Cheapest, easy, short-lived
- V-strip (tension seal): More durable
- Felt: Traditional, not as effective
- Rubber bulb: Best for doors

**Window film:**
- Plastic film applied with heat gun
- Creates insulating air pocket
- Seasonal solution (remove in spring)
- Very effective, inexpensive

**Caulk:**
- For gaps around frame (non-moving parts)
- Paintable caulk blends in
- Lasts 5-10 years

### Finding Drafts

- Hold candle near window, watch flame
- Feel with wet hand (evaporation makes cold feel colder)
- On cold day, feel around entire frame
- Use incense stick to see air movement

### When to Replace Windows

Consider replacement if:
- Windows are 20+ years old
- Single-pane glass
- Significant visible damage
- Seals have failed (fogging between panes)
- Drafts can't be fixed with weatherization
- Energy bills are high

## Broken Window Glass

### Safety First
- Wear heavy gloves and eye protection
- Place drop cloth to catch fragments
- Dispose of glass safely (wrap in newspaper)

### Single-Pane Glass Replacement

**Remove broken glass:**
- Remove glazing points (small metal triangles)
- Scrape out old putty
- Clean frame thoroughly

**Install new glass:**
- Measure opening, subtract 1/8" for expansion
- Have glass cut at hardware store
- Apply thin bead of glazing compound in frame
- Set glass, press gently
- Install new glazing points (every 8 inches)
- Apply glazing compound around perimeter
- Smooth with putty knife at 45-degree angle
- Let cure before painting (follow product directions)

### Insulated Glass (Double-Pane)

**Seal failure (foggy between panes):**
- Glass itself is fine
- Seal between panes has failed
- Options: Replace glass unit or entire sash
- Usually not DIY - requires ordering custom glass

## Screen Repair

**Small holes:**
- Clear nail polish
- Patch kit for larger holes

**Major damage:**
- Remove screen from frame
- Take to hardware store for rescreening
- Or buy spline and roll tool for DIY
- Lay new screen over frame
- Press spline into channel with roller
- Trim excess screen

# Appliance Troubleshooting

## Refrigerator Problems

### Not Cold Enough

**Check 1: Temperature settings**
- Verify settings weren't accidentally changed
- Allow 24 hours for temperature to stabilize after adjusting

**Check 2: Condenser coils**
- Located on back or bottom of refrigerator
- Vacuum dust and debris
- Clean every 6-12 months

**Check 3: Door seals**
- Close door on paper - should resist pulling
- Clean seals with warm soapy water
- Replace if cracked or not sealing

**Check 4: Airflow**
- Don't overstuff refrigerator
- Don't block vents between freezer and fridge
- Leave space around refrigerator for ventilation

### Making Strange Noises

**Humming:** Normal compressor sound
**Clicking:** Could be defrost timer (normal) or failing compressor
**Rattling:** Check if something is touching the back or sides
**Gurgling:** Normal refrigerant movement

### Ice Maker Not Working

1. Verify ice maker is turned on
2. Check water supply line isn't kinked
3. Check water filter (replace every 6 months)
4. Check water inlet valve (may be frozen or clogged)

## Dishwasher Problems

### Not Draining

**Check 1: Garbage disposal**
- If connected to disposal, run disposal first
- New installation: remove disposal knockout plug

**Check 2: Drain filter**
- Located at bottom of dishwasher
- Remove and clean debris

**Check 3: Drain hose**
- Check for kinks
- Should have high loop under counter (prevents backflow)

**Check 4: Air gap**
- Small cylinder on countertop near sink
- Remove cap, clean debris

### Not Cleaning Well

- Clean spray arms (remove and clear holes with toothpick)
- Use dishwasher cleaner monthly
- Check water temperature (should be 120°F minimum)
- Don't pre-rinse (detergent needs food to work on)
- Load properly (don't block spray arms)

### Won't Start

- Check door latch (won't run if door not fully closed)
- Check control lock (may be accidentally activated)
- Reset by turning off breaker for 1 minute
- Check inlet valve (may hear humming if it's trying to fill)

## Washing Machine Problems

### Won't Drain or Spin

**Check 1: Load balance**
- Redistribute clothes
- Don't overload

**Check 2: Drain filter (front loaders)**
- Usually lower front corner
- Clean out debris, coins, etc.

**Check 3: Drain hose**
- Check for kinks
- Check for clogs at standpipe

**Check 4: Lid switch (top loaders)**
- Won't spin if lid appears open
- Test switch continuity

### Vibrating/Walking

- Level the machine (adjust feet)
- Use all four feet (no shimming with cardboard)
- Don't overload
- Ensure floor is sturdy

### Smells Musty

- Clean door seal (front loaders) weekly
- Leave door ajar between uses
- Run cleaning cycle with bleach or washer cleaner monthly
- Use correct amount of HE detergent (less is more)

## Dryer Problems

### Not Heating

**Electric dryer:**
- Check both breakers (240V uses two breakers)
- Check thermal fuse (requires meter to test)

**Gas dryer:**
- **SAFETY WARNING:** If you smell gas, do not operate any switches or appliances. Leave immediately and call your gas company from outside.
- Verify gas valve is open
- Check igniter (should glow when dryer runs)
- Check thermal fuse
- If uncomfortable with gas appliances, call a professional

### Taking Too Long to Dry

**Check 1: Lint filter**
- Clean before every load
- Wash with soap monthly (dryer sheet buildup)

**Check 2: Exhaust vent**
- Disconnect and check for clogs
- Clean entire vent line annually
- Verify outside vent flap opens when dryer runs

**Check 3: Vent length/type**
- Rigid metal vent is best
- Flexible foil ducts can crush and clog
- Keep run as short as possible

**Fire hazard:** Clogged dryer vents cause thousands of fires yearly. Clean annually.

## Garbage Disposal (See Plumbing Section)

Quick reference:
- Won't turn on: Press reset button, check breaker
- Hums but won't spin: Use Allen wrench in bottom center
- Drains slowly: Possible clog in P-trap or further down
