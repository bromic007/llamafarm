# USDA Plant Hardiness Zones

## Understanding the Zone System

The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides North America into 13 zones based on average annual minimum winter temperatures. Each zone represents a 10°F range, with "a" and "b" subdivisions representing 5°F differences.

### Zone Temperature Ranges

| Zone | Temperature Range (°F) | Example Locations |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | -60 to -50 | Interior Alaska |
| 2 | -50 to -40 | Northern Minnesota, Montana |
| 3 | -40 to -30 | Northern Wisconsin, Wyoming |
| 4 | -30 to -20 | Southern Minnesota, Colorado mountains |
| 5 | -20 to -10 | Iowa, Kansas, Southern New England |
| 6 | -10 to 0 | Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia |
| 7 | 0 to 10 | Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina |
| 8 | 10 to 20 | Texas, Georgia, Pacific Northwest coast |
| 9 | 20 to 30 | Florida, Southern California, Gulf Coast |
| 10 | 30 to 40 | Southern Florida, San Diego |
| 11 | 40 to 50 | Hawaii, Puerto Rico |
| 12 | 50 to 60 | Hawaii (warmest areas) |
| 13 | 60 to 70 | Puerto Rico (warmest areas) |

## Using Your Zone Effectively

### What Zones Tell You
- Which perennial plants will survive winter in your area
- When to expect your last spring frost and first fall frost
- General guidelines for planting schedules

### What Zones Don't Tell You
- Summer heat tolerance (use AHS Heat Zones for this)
- Rainfall and humidity patterns
- Soil type and quality
- Microclimates in your specific yard

### Finding Your Zone
1. Visit the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map at planthardiness.ars.usda.gov
2. Enter your zip code for precise zone information
3. Note both your zone number and subdivision (a or b)

## Microclimates in Your Yard

Even within a single property, conditions can vary significantly:

**Warmer Microclimates:**
- South-facing walls (absorb and radiate heat)
- Areas protected from wind
- Near large rocks or pavement (thermal mass)
- Sheltered courtyards

**Cooler Microclimates:**
- North-facing slopes
- Low-lying areas where cold air settles (frost pockets)
- Shaded areas
- Near bodies of water (in summer)

## Regional Growing Considerations

### Northeast (Zones 4-7)
- Short but intense growing season
- Last frost typically April-May
- First frost typically September-October
- Challenges: Late spring frosts, early fall frosts, rocky soil

### Southeast (Zones 7-9)
- Long growing season
- High humidity and heat in summer
- Mild winters allow year-round growing in many areas
- Challenges: Extreme summer heat, fungal diseases, heavy clay soil

### Midwest (Zones 3-6)
- Extreme temperature swings
- Rich prairie soils in many areas
- Last frost April-May, first frost September-October
- Challenges: Harsh winters, spring flooding, summer droughts

### Southwest (Zones 7-10)
- Low humidity, intense sun
- Alkaline soils common
- Some areas allow year-round growing
- Challenges: Extreme heat, water scarcity, caliche soil

### Pacific Northwest (Zones 7-9)
- Mild, wet winters; dry summers
- Long growing season for cool-weather crops
- Excellent for perennials
- Challenges: Slugs, late blight, summer watering needs

### Mountain West (Zones 3-6)
- High altitude intensifies sun exposure
- Large temperature swings (day to night)
- Short but sunny growing season
- Challenges: Thin air, intense UV, short season, poor soil

# Vegetable Growing Guides

## Tomatoes

### Planting
- Start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost
- Transplant when soil reaches 60°F
- Plant deep (bury 2/3 of stem)
- Space 24-36 inches apart

### Care
- Water deeply and consistently (1-2 inches per week)
- Mulch to prevent soil splash and retain moisture
- Stake or cage indeterminate varieties
- Remove suckers for larger fruit (optional)

### Common Problems
- **Blossom end rot**: Calcium deficiency from inconsistent watering. Keep soil evenly moist.
- **Early blight**: Brown spots with concentric rings. Remove affected leaves, mulch well.
- **Late blight**: Gray-green water-soaked spots. Destroy affected plants immediately.
- **Hornworms**: Large green caterpillars. Hand-pick or use Bt.
- **Cracking**: Caused by uneven watering. Maintain consistent moisture.

### Harvest
- Pick when fully colored but still firm
- For best flavor, don't refrigerate
- Days to maturity: 60-85 days from transplant

## Peppers

### Planting
- Start indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost
- Transplant when soil reaches 65°F
- Space 18-24 inches apart
- Peppers like warm soil - use black plastic mulch

### Care
- Water 1-2 inches per week
- Fertilize moderately (too much nitrogen = lots of leaves, few peppers)
- Support plants if heavily loaded with fruit

### Common Problems
- **Blossom drop**: Temperature too hot (above 90°F) or too cold (below 55°F)
- **Sunscald**: White or tan patches. Maintain leaf cover over fruits.
- **Aphids**: Spray with water or insecticidal soap.

### Harvest
- Green peppers: Pick when full-sized and firm
- Colored peppers: Leave on plant until fully colored
- Hot peppers: Usually hottest when fully ripe
- Days to maturity: 60-90 days from transplant

## Cucumbers

### Planting
- Direct sow 1-2 weeks after last frost
- Or start indoors 3-4 weeks before (transplant carefully)
- Space 12 inches apart (vining) or 24 inches (bush)
- Soil temperature must be above 60°F

### Care
- Need consistent moisture (critical during flowering/fruiting)
- Provide trellis for vining types
- Mulch heavily
- Pick frequently to encourage production

### Common Problems
- **Powdery mildew**: White powder on leaves. Plant resistant varieties, improve air circulation.
- **Cucumber beetles**: Yellow-green beetles with stripes or spots. Use row covers, hand-pick.
- **Bitter fruit**: Caused by stress (heat, drought, temperature swings).

### Harvest
- Pick slicing cucumbers at 6-8 inches
- Pick pickling cucumbers at 2-4 inches
- Harvest every 2-3 days
- Days to maturity: 50-70 days

## Squash (Summer and Winter)

### Summer Squash (Zucchini, Yellow Squash)

# Pest and Disease Management

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### The IPM Approach
1. **Prevention**: Healthy soil, proper spacing, resistant varieties
2. **Monitoring**: Regular inspection, identify problems early
3. **Identification**: Know what you're dealing with before treating
4. **Intervention**: Start with least toxic methods

### Cultural Controls
- Rotate crops (don't plant same family in same spot for 3 years)
- Clean up plant debris
- Water in morning (leaves dry before night)
- Provide proper spacing for air circulation
- Choose disease-resistant varieties

## Common Insect Pests

### Aphids
- **Identify**: Tiny soft-bodied insects in clusters, often on new growth
- **Damage**: Distorted leaves, sticky honeydew, sooty mold
- **Control**: Strong water spray, insecticidal soap, ladybugs, lacewings

### Tomato Hornworm
- **Identify**: Large green caterpillar with white stripes, horn on rear
- **Damage**: Defoliated tomato, pepper, eggplant
- **Control**: Hand-pick (check daily), Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), encourage parasitic wasps

### Japanese Beetles
- **Identify**: Metallic green and copper beetles
- **Damage**: Skeletonized leaves, damaged flowers
- **Control**: Hand-pick into soapy water, milky spore for grubs, neem oil

### Squash Vine Borer
- **Identify**: Moth larvae bore into squash stems
- **Damage**: Sudden wilt, sawdust-like frass at stem base
- **Control**: Row covers until flowering, wrap stems, plant resistant varieties (butternut)

### Cabbage Worms
- **Identify**: Green caterpillars on brassicas
- **Damage**: Holes in leaves, boring into heads
- **Control**: Row covers, Bt, hand-pick

### Slugs and Snails
- **Identify**: Slimy trails, irregular holes in leaves

# Watering and Irrigation

## How Much Water Do Plants Need?

### General Guidelines
- Most vegetables: 1-2 inches per week
- Sandy soil: More frequent, smaller amounts
- Clay soil: Less frequent, deeper watering
- Hot/windy weather: Increase watering
- Mulched gardens: Reduce watering by 25%

### Measuring Water
- Rain gauge: Track rainfall
- Tuna can test: Place empty can in garden, water until 1 inch accumulates
- Soil probe: Check moisture at root level

### Signs of Water Stress

**Under-watering:**
- Wilting (that doesn't recover overnight)
- Dry, crispy leaves
- Blossom drop
- Stunted growth

**Over-watering:**
- Wilting (even with wet soil)
- Yellow leaves
- Root rot
- Mold or fungus

## Watering Methods

### Hand Watering
- **Pros**: Precise control, inspect plants while watering
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, inconsistent
- **Best for**: Containers, small gardens, seedlings

### Soaker Hoses
- **Pros**: Efficient, keeps foliage dry, inexpensive
- **Cons**: Uneven distribution over long runs, degrades in sun
- **Best for**: Row gardens, perennial beds

### Drip Irrigation
- **Pros**: Very efficient, precise, reduces disease
- **Cons**: Initial setup cost, can clog
- **Best for**: Established gardens, large areas, water conservation

### Sprinklers
- **Pros**: Covers large area, mimics rain
- **Cons**: Wastes water, wets foliage (disease risk), wind interference
- **Best for**: Lawns, new seed beds

## Watering Best Practices

1. **Water deeply and less frequently** - Encourages deep root growth
2. **Water in the morning** - Leaves dry before nightfall, less disease
3. **Water at soil level** - Keep foliage dry when possible
4. **Mulch, mulch, mulch** - Reduces evaporation dramatically
5. **Group plants by water needs** - Efficient irrigation planning

## Water Conservation

- Use mulch (2-4 inches)
- Choose drought-tolerant varieties
- Improve soil with organic matter
- Install rain barrels
- Use efficient irrigation (drip)
- Water only when needed (check soil first)

# Container and Small-Space Gardening

## Container Basics

### Container Selection
- **Drainage**: Must have drainage holes
- **Size**: Bigger is better (more soil = more water/nutrients)
- **Material**: Plastic (lightweight, retains moisture), terracotta (breathable, dries faster), fabric (air prunes roots)

### Minimum Container Sizes
| Plant | Minimum Size |
|-------|-------------|
| Lettuce, herbs | 6-8 inches deep |
| Peppers, bush beans | 12 inches deep, 5 gallons |
| Tomatoes, cucumbers | 18 inches deep, 10+ gallons |
| Squash | 24 inches deep, 15+ gallons |

### Potting Mix
- Never use garden soil in containers
- Use quality potting mix
- Can add: perlite (drainage), compost (nutrients), vermiculite (moisture retention)
- Refresh or replace annually

### Container Watering
- Check daily in summer (twice daily for small pots in heat)
- Water until it runs from drainage holes
- Consider self-watering containers or drip irrigation
- Mulch top of containers

### Container Fertilizing
- Nutrients wash out with watering
- Use slow-release fertilizer at planting
- Supplement with liquid fertilizer every 1-2 weeks
- Watch for nutrient deficiency (yellowing, purple leaves)

## Small-Space Strategies

### Vertical Gardening
- Trellises for beans, peas, cucumbers
- Tomato cages and stakes
- Wall-mounted planters
- Hanging baskets

### Succession Planting
- Plant new crops as others finish
- Example: Lettuce → beans → fall greens
- Maximizes harvest from limited space

### Interplanting
- Grow fast crops between slow crops
- Example: Radishes between tomatoes (harvested before tomatoes need space)
- Lettuce under tall plants for shade

### Square Foot Gardening
- Intensive method: 1-foot squares
- Each square gets specific number of plants based on size
- Great for beginners and small spaces

### Best Vegetables for Small Spaces
- Lettuce and greens
- Radishes
- Bush beans
- Compact tomato varieties (determinate)
- Herbs
- Peppers
- Strawberries

## Shade Gardening

### Vegetables for Partial Shade (3-6 hours sun)
- Lettuce and salad greens
- Spinach
- Kale
- Swiss chard
- Herbs: parsley, cilantro, chives, mint
- Root vegetables (will be smaller)

### Managing Shade
- Prune overhanging branches if possible
- Use reflective surfaces to bounce light
- Choose light-colored containers
- Focus on leafy greens (don't need sun to ripen fruit)
