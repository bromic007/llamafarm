Neural Scaling Laws: Understanding Model Performance

Abstract

Recent research has revealed remarkable regularities in the scaling behavior of neural language models. This paper explores the empirical scaling laws that govern the relationship between model size, dataset size, compute budget, and model performance. We demonstrate that these relationships follow predictable power laws across many orders of magnitude.

1. Introduction

The performance of neural networks improves predictably as we scale up model size, dataset size, and computational resources. These scaling laws have profound implications for how we design and train large language models.

Key findings include:
- Performance improves as a power law with model size
- Data requirements scale predictably with model capacity
- Compute-optimal training requires balanced scaling
- Transfer learning benefits from scale

2. Empirical Observations

2.1 Model Size Scaling
As we increase the number of parameters N in a model, the test loss L typically follows:
L(N) = (N_c / N)^α_N

Where N_c is a critical model size and α_N ≈ 0.076 for language models.

2.2 Dataset Size Scaling
Similarly, with dataset size D:
L(D) = (D_c / D)^α_D

Where D_c is a critical dataset size and α_D ≈ 0.095.

2.3 Compute Budget Scaling
When optimally allocating a fixed compute budget C:
L(C) = (C_c / C)^α_C

Where α_C ≈ 0.050, suggesting that compute is the most important factor.

3. Practical Implications

3.1 Chinchilla Scaling
The Chinchilla paper revealed that many large models are undertrained. For compute-optimal training:
- Parameters and tokens should scale equally
- N_opt ∝ C^0.5
- D_opt ∝ C^0.5

3.2 Emergence of Capabilities
Certain capabilities emerge predictably at specific scales:
- Arithmetic: ~10^9 parameters
- Factual knowledge: ~10^10 parameters
- Complex reasoning: ~10^11 parameters
- In-context learning: Improves continuously with scale

4. Theoretical Understanding

4.1 Power Laws in Neural Networks
The ubiquity of power laws suggests deep connections to:
- Information theory
- Statistical mechanics
- Optimization landscapes
- Compositional structure of natural data

4.2 Infinite Data Limit
In the limit of infinite data, performance is bottlenecked by model capacity:
- Larger models can utilize more data
- But there are diminishing returns
- Optimal scaling balances these factors

5. Future Directions

5.1 Efficient Scaling
Research into more efficient architectures:
- Mixture of experts
- Sparse models
- Retrieval augmentation
- Tool use

5.2 Beyond Simple Scaling
Understanding when scaling breaks down:
- Task-specific bottlenecks
- Architectural limitations
- Data quality issues
- Alignment challenges

6. Conclusion

Neural scaling laws provide a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting model performance. These laws guide practical decisions about resource allocation and help us understand the fundamental limits of neural network learning.

The consistent power-law relationships across different scales and modalities suggest that these patterns reflect fundamental properties of learning in high-dimensional spaces.
